# Objects

An *object* is a collection of *properties*, which are described in the form of *key/value* pairs.
We can use objects to model "things" using code.

## Methods

When an object has a property with a function as the value, itis referred to as a method of that object.

While it's tehnically correct to say Math.random() and cosole.log(), random and log are functions, when a function is associated only with a specific object using the term method is more
specific since it implies association with an object, and not a global function.
