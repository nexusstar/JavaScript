# JavaScript Timers

* Two timers in JavaScript
   - `setTimeout`
   - `setInterval`
* Both take two arguments, a function to invoke and delay period

   _The smallest delay period allowed by browsers is 4ms_

## `setTimeout`

_setTimeout_ will execute the function once

## `setInterval`

_setInterval_ will execute continuously with the specified delay between
each execution
